## About this Book

We’re glad we can join you on your journey towards becoming a board certified clinical informatician. Our goal is to provide you with a concise presentation of the basic principles of clinical informatics in an easy to understand format. As you prepare for the exam, we hope you use this book in combination with your clinical experience as part of your toolkit. 
We will cover the major topics in the examination content outline, though we may have reorganized some of it in the interest of flow and clarity. Each section will focus on a “core content” topic. We have also recommended some additional reading at the end of most sections for those who find a topic interesting and would like to dive deeper into the subject. To facilitate rapid assimilation of this material, as well as demonstrating hierarchical relationships between concepts, we will frequently use bulleted lists. The major sections of this book are as follows:

- Exam Details
- Clinical Informatics Overview
- The Health System
- Clinical Decision Making and Care Process Improvement
- Evidence Based Patient Care
- Workflows Analysis, Process Redesign, and Quality Improvement
- Health Information Technology Systems
- Human Factors Engineering
- Health Information Systems Applications
- Clinical Data Standards
- Information System Lifecycle
- Leadership and Managing Change

 
## Practice Questions & Additional Study Materials
### Practice Questions
Each chapter in this book has review questions designed to test your understanding of the topics covered. For those interested, additional practice questions, practice exams, and other materials and resources are available on our website at www.informaticspro.com.
We would like to note that it is likely that there will be differences between the types of questions we present and the questions on the actual exam. Since we have no knowledge of the style and types of test questions, our questions will be written following the National Board of Medical Examiners guide for written test questions for the basic and clinical sciences. The intent of these questions is to help guide you in your preparation for the exam.

### Additional Study Materials
If you’re looking for additional study materials, the clinical informatics core content outline available at http://www.theabpm.org/applicationci/ci_studyguide.pdf does include recommended reading. While it would be great if you could read all the books and journals on the list, we know that time will likely prevent you from doing so. 
With that being said, if you’re going to read another book in addition to this one, we would highly recommend Shortliffe & Cimino’s book “Biomedical Informatics: Computer Applications in Health Care and Biomedicine”.
