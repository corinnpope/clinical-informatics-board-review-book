## 3.1 Determinants of Individual and Population Health
The World Health Organization lists the determinants (circumstances and environment) affecting health to include:16

• Social and Economic Environment

• Physical Environment

• Individual Characteristics and Behaviors

Some of these determinants can include income and social status, education, physical environment, social network, genetics, access to health services, and gender. There is also a significant body of research regarding the importance of transportation, food and agriculture, housing, waste, energy, industry, urbanization, water, radiation, and nutrition and health on individual and population health. This research has shown how individual and population health are impacted by many factors within the societal milieu.

## 3.2 Domains of the Health System
In this section, we will be exploring some of the primary domains of the health system including healthcare delivery, its implications for public health, healthcare research, education of health professionals, and aspects of personal health. Many of these concepts will be explored in depth in later sections in this book, so view this section as a brief survey of these concepts.

As you might expect, the health system with in United States is the result of interactions between components and organizations at many levels. Although it is beyond the scope of this book to fully describe these interrelationships, what we hope to achieve is an understanding of how these interactions affect and are affected by clinical informatics.

### 3.2.1 The Healthcare Delivery System
The WHO defines a health system as an entity that encompasses all of the activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health. This includes human capital, organizations, and other resources responsible for providing, regulating, and financing these activities.

The United States healthcare system is a complicated one. A single entity does not cover the entire spectrum of healthcare delivery. Rather, public health, private healthcare organizations, certifying bodies, insurance companies, research, pharmaceuticals, product vendors, education, personal health, quality initiatives, economics, and data all work together to deliver health care to patients.

#### 3.2.1.1 Public Health Care
Public health care is funded by taxpayer money. When you think of public health care you probably think of Medicaid and Medicare, but public health care also includes programs such as TRICARE for members of the uniformed services, their families, and survivors, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid, but cannot afford private insurance.

The demand for public health care is expected to increase in the future due to demographic shifts. In fact, 30% of Americans will be enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid by 2022.17

Figure 3-1. Projected Change in Medicare Enrollment, 2000-2050.17

Medicare is a federal health insurance program for those over 65, certain younger people with disabilities, and those that meet certain criteria. Medicare Part A is designed for citizens over 65 years of age, regardless of financial need and those under 65 that qualify by meeting certain criteria for disability, have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or permanent kidney failure, have worked long-term in a government position, or are the child, widow(er), or divorced widow(er) of someone over 50 years old who worked in a long-term government position. Individuals may receive Medicare Part B benefits which includephysician services, outpatient care, home health care, equipment, some preventative services if they meet the qualifications for Part A. Part B requires additional monthly premiums. Part D is similar to Part B except it helps cover prescription drug costs.

An increasing trend in healthcare is the privatization of public health programs, essentially creating a new hybrid approach to the traditional public vs. private health care delivery paradigm. Known as Part C, or “Medicare Advantage”, it is when a private insurer manages Medicare benefits while the government pays the premiums. Depending on the plan, the individual may pay monthly premiums to cover additional services. While this has disadvantages such as restricted choice of physicians for patients, it is better funded than traditional Medicare. Many state governments that are responsible for Medicaid management have been outsourcing programs in this manner to rein in costs.
Medicaid covers certain citizens who meet income restrictions and/or other categorical criteria outlined by each state’s program, such as pregnant females, low-income children and seniors, and parents of Medicaid-eligible children. It is jointly funded by state and federal government, but managed by individual states and covers a wider range of services than Medicare.

#### 3.2.1.2 Private Healthcare

Those who do not qualify for public programs must purchase private health insurance for themselves or enroll through an employer as mandated by the ACA. Private healthcare insurance is managed through non-profit, public, or private companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Cigna, Health Net, Humana, WellPoint, and others.

Private insurers tend to offer multiple options to customers for managed care services that contain costs for the insurer through prepayments of services or discounted fee-for services. Among the most popular managed care insurance options are:

• **Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)**: HMOs focus on health maintenance and require primary physician approval for additional services to contain costs. The primary means for reimbursement in HMOs is capitation, or a fixed monetary amount per patient for services–regardless of actual services rendered.

• **Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)**: PPOs consist of physicians, healthcare organizations, and providers contracted with the insurance company to provide services. Physicians are typically reimbursed using discounted fees or on a contracted fee basis.

• **Independent Practice Associations (IPAs)**: IPAs are associations or contracting organizations of independent physicians. Physicians are reimbursed using capitation, fee-for-service, or by a flat retainer fee.
Insurance providers may also provide additional plans or services to meet the wants and needs of customers such as:

• **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**: HSAs allow the patient to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare expenses

• **Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs)**: Patients are not required to have a primary care provider, but still must receive care within a predetermined network

• **Point of Service (POS)**: A patient’s primary care provider becomes their “point of service” from which they can obtain care from inside their network or be referred to an out of network provider (though the plan offers lesser compensation in such circumstances)

• **High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)**: Patients not expecting to incur high healthcare costs may choose a high deductible plan in exchange for lower monthly premiums

• **Catastrophic Health Insurance**: Healthy young adults who do not use healthcare resources frequently may choose a low-cost catastrophic plan where medical costs in the case of an emergency are still covered

• **Discount Medical Cards**:Patients may purchase a discount medical card in exchange for lower rates on health care

As you may have noticed, a small number of large healthcare insurers have a majority of the health insurance market captured. Because of this, the relationship between insurers and providers can sometimes be described as a **monopsony**, or an imperfect competition theory in microeconomics where one buyer interfaces with many sellers. We’ll cover the economics of insurance, reimbursements, and other financial issues further along in the chapter. Other economic issues will also be discussed in the Organizational Finance section in chapter twelve.

### 3.2.2 Healthcare Organizational Structure

Although every organization is organized differently, there are common elements that exist between many of them. Like other industries, a CEO will report to a governing board in a typical large health care organization.

Executive positions such as Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Medical Information Officer (CMIO), Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Chief of Staff (COS), Chief of Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and other executive positions may exist within the organization and typically report to the CEO. A health care organization may have some, all, or even none of the positions mentioned depending on its size and maturity.

These executive level positions may also have department chairpersons, vice presidents, medical staff officers, and other staff reporting to them. Medical staff may also further organize through departments and committees. You can see a sample organizational chart for a large healthcare-focused organization in Figure 3-2 below.

The relationships between executives and departments may be informally or formally managed. Certain actions such as changing directors, selling shares in the organization, or bringing on investors may be formally managed through an organization’s bylaws. These bylaws outline the roles and responsibilities of the board and of board members. Organizations almost always choose to adopt and maintain bylaws to serve as the rules and regulations to guide the organization and the organization’s staff and patient population.
