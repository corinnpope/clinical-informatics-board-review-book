# Clinical Informatics Board Review: Pass the Exam the First Time

# This is a Work in Progress

Here's the plan as it stands.

- Take the original Word document and break it out into individual word doc files
  - Take those word docs and convert them to markdown
  - We may run into some issues with images - not sure how many of the originals I actually have anywhere - some may need re-creation or will just be screenshotted
- Accept any PRs to update content

# Background

We started on the initial version in 2013. Since then, we've decided to open source all the content we've created so far. Why? Because we:
- legit want there to be more clinical informaticians in the world
- want to make sure we're always up-to-date on the latest topics in clinical informatics
- don't have a publishing house to answer to (yay for self-publishing!)

# Contributing

Want to help out? Get your feet wet with git plus get a few PRs under your belt? We'd love for you to help. Whether it's the smallest typo fix or adding an entire chapter, anything you would like to do to improve the book will be considered for inclusion.
