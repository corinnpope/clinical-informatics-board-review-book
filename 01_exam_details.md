# Exam Details
## Topics Covered
The clinical informatics subspecialty board certification exam covers a wide variety of topics ranging from leadership and change management to clinical information system implementation. Within your current studies and experience, it is likely you have touched on many of these topics, while there may be some you have never studied before. It is our goal to bring you up to a level of understanding and knowledge that will allow you to pass your board exam.  

The informatics exam covers four major topic areas: informatics fundamentals, leaning and managing change, clinical decision making and process improvement, and health information systems. In terms of topic distribution, the test should cover four main areas in the proportions depicted below in Figure 1 1. 
 
Figure 1 1. Composition of the Exam.

According to the ABPM, (the overseer of the exam) the questions should reflect situations potentially faced as a practicing clinical informatician. In particular, the ABPM states: 
There are no trick questions, and it would be unusual for a question to reflect very recent events or issues (i.e., new “hot” topics) because of the lead time necessary to develop the full examination. The general purpose is to ascertain whether there is a sound base of specialty relevant knowledge and skills and the ability to exercise discernment and judgment.
-and-
The distribution of examination questions is weighted in favor of relevance to actual practice; however, candidates who are preparing to represent themselves as competent must recognize they are responsible for knowledge and skills across the breadth of their chosen subspecialty, not just in the preponderant content of their personal day-to-day practice. Examinations do not stress esoteric facts, and they do require examinees to demonstrate sound understanding. A primary purpose of this outline is to describe the extent of the subspecialty.   

The exam should not require you to memorize obscure acronyms or uncommon definitions. We will attempt to get you to a point where you can take the information presented in this book and apply it to common scenarios you may face in practice and on the examination.

*Note: Those certified by the American Board of Pathology must apply through ABPath. All others may apply through ABPM. 
###	Licensure
Applicants must possess an unrestricted and currently valid license or licenses to practice medicine in a state, the District of Columbia, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, or in a Province of Canada.  
###	One of the Following “Pathways” to Certification
Due to a recent extension of the grandfather period, through 2022, either pathway below is acceptable. After 2023, applicants must complete a minimum 24-month clinical informatics fellowship accredited by ACGME. 
####	Practice Pathway
Three years of practice in Clinical Informatics is required. Practice time must be at least 25% of a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) to be considered. Practice time need not be continuous, however, all practice time must have occurred in the five-year interval immediately preceding application for certification. 

- Practice must consist of broad-based professional activity with significant clinical informatics responsibility. 
- Documentation of clinical informatics research and teaching activities may also be submitted for review if it includes significant clinical informatics responsibility. 
- Verification is required that the equivalent of at least 3 years of an individual's professional time has been devoted to the practice of clinical informatics during the five years prior to application for the examination. 

A person or persons who are knowledgeable about the applicant’s practice, such as the Chief of Staff, the applicable department chair, the director of a related clinical informatics training program, or the director of the clinical informatics program in the related institution must complete the verification. Completion of the verification by a partner or practice associate is not acceptable. The verification form will be available at the time of application. 

For those who completed non-accredited fellowship training of less than 24 months, the fellowship-training curriculum as well as a description of the actual training must also be submitted. The applicant must submit evidence of additional practice to satisfy any additional Practice Pathway requirements. 
####	Fellowship Training Pathway
For those taking the fellowship pathway, completion of a fellowship program of at least 24 months in duration that is ACGME accredited is required. 

As of late 2016, programs with an ACGME certified clinical informatics program include: 
- Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
- Boston Children’s Hospital 
- Case Western Reserve University
- The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
- Columbia University
- David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and UCLA Health
- Duke University
- Geisinger Health System
- Madigan Army Medical Center
- Massachusetts General Hospital
- Ohio State University
- Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine
- Regenstrief Institute, Inc.
- Stanford School of Medicine
- SUNY—University at Buffalo
- The University of Arizona College of Medicine—Phoenix
- University of California—San Diego
- University of California—San Francisco
- University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine
- University of New Mexico
- University of Washington
- Vanderbilt University Medical Center Program
- Yale University
- Washington University in St. Louis
As clinical informatics grows and matures, expect to see this list expand. In fact, it may have expanded since the time this book was printed, so be sure to check out the ACGME website at https://apps.acgme.org/ads/public/reports/report/1 to search for accredited fellowships. 
## Exam Day
###	The Exam Format
The exam is a computer-based exam consisting of 200 equally weighted multiple-choice questions with a four-hour time limit. There are no penalties for guessing. Question types may include:
- Clinical vignettes
- Experimental or statistical observations
- Definitions or classifications
- Administrative problems
- Applications of principles or regulations
- Scenarios that may be seen in practice
Following basic test taking strategy, if you don’t know the answer, eliminate the improbable answers and then take your best guess from the remaining possibilities.
Do not leave any questions blank, as every question is weighted equally and there are no penalties for incorrect answers.  If you’re unsure of a question, you can mark it and come back to it at the end of the exam if time permits. 
Before the test questions begin, there will be an optional tutorial on how to use the computer-based testing system. You can choose to click through it quickly to get to the questions, go through it thoroughly to understand the system, or you can choose to use the time for a “brain dump” before beginning the exam. 
A tutorial for the computer-based system is available at http://measurementresearch.com/testing/tutorial.shtml. 
###	Registering for the Exam
To be eligible to take the exam, individuals are required to fill out an application and pay a non-refundable application fee. If it is determined you meet the requirements, you will then have to pay an examination fee. Once these two steps are complete, applicants will receive a confirmation letter from which they can register for the exam—either through Pearson VUE or the ABPM’s registration hotline at 877-392-3926.  Please make sure that you check with ABPM for the latest details, since cancellations or deferrals occurring before the cancellation date will incur an administrative fee. Cancellations occurring after the cancellation date will not receive a refund or deferral. 
###	The Exam Location
Testing is done at Pearson VUE locations across the US. You may choose which one is most convenient for you. Be sure to arrive 30 minutes early for your exam. Late arrivals will forfeit their seat. It is also strongly recommended that you bring several forms of ID with you, just in case, as well as your confirmation letter. Pearson VUE is strict with their identification policy and will not let you take the exam if you can’t prove who you say you are.
