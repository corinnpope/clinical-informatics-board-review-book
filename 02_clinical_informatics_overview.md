#	Clinical Informatics Overview
Clinical Informatics is the application of informatics, clinical knowledge, and technology to continuously improve healthcare systems, services, and outcomes. It seeks ways to:
- Better assess, design, implement, and evaluate clinical information systems for providers, patients, and administrators. 
- Understand, evaluate, and re-engineer clinical processes so they may improve the quality of healthcare and create efficient and effective workflows.
- Lead and manage organizations through times of change—especially through information technology (IT), clinical, regulatory, and health system changes.
- Improve the clinical decision-making process.
As depicted below in Figure 2 1, clinical informatics as a discipline resides at the intersection of three major domains: the health system, clinical care, and information & communications technology. 
- Clinical care concerns the clinical care of patients, clinical decision-making, and clinical workflows. 
- The health system concerns managing individual and population health, the regulations and requirements of the healthcare system, health economics and financing, and managing and improving the quality of care. 
- Information and communications technology concerns computer systems, architecture, networks, and other technical underpinnings of clinical information systems that keep health care systems up and running.

## What is a Clinical Informatician?
According to the American Medical Informatics Association, a clinical informatician is someone who transforms healthcare by “analyzing, designing, implementing, and evaluating information and communication systems that enhance individual and population health outcomes, improve patient care, and strengthen the clinical-patient relationship.”    Essentially, a clinical informatician is a change agent to help bring information technology to the clinical domain. 

## Informatics History
The recording of healthcare data has existed since Hippocrates first developed the medical record in the fifth century.  Since then, records have evolved from tablets and paper ledgers to electronic repositories. However, over the course of health record development, there has never been a “standard” patient record. Configurations, units of measurement, and styles of recording have made the conversion from written record to electronic health record one of the greatest challenges in the health information technology industry. We are making significant process towards interoperability in healthcare using technology, standards, best practices, new research, regulations, and informed stakeholders, but true, universal interoperability still eludes us.
Fifty years ago, the first research on diagnostic decision-making, “Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis,” reviewed methods that could be used where risk and uncertainty existed.  This paper began the conversation on computer-based clinical decision support. Following this, additional papers were published in the mid-80’s that included topics on medical informatics frameworks, functional and architectural considerations for clinical information systems, medical research analysis, and standardizing electrocardiogram analyses from computers.  
In terms of informatics, the use of computer technology in the early 1950s began to influence the field of medicine and the first health informatics organizations were born. The first of which was founded in Germany during 1949, with more and more beginning to appear during the 1960s and 70s across Europe and the United States. The largest and most prominent professional organization from this time is the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). 
In 1989, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) was formed to be the United States representative to IMIA through the integration and merging of the following informatics organizations:
- American Association for Medical Systems and Informatics
- American College of Medical Informatics
- Symposium on Computer Applications and Medical Care
Its mission is to “lead the way in transforming health care through trusted science, education, and the practice of informatics”.  In 2005, AMIA began the process to make clinical informatics a recognized subspecialty of the American Board of Preventative Medicine. Figure 2 2 shows the timeline of clinical informatics as a subspecialty. 
 
Figure 2 2. Timeline for the Evolution of the Clinical Informatics Sub-Specialty.
The first class of diplomates received their certification in 2013. The 2017 exam will produce the fifth cohort of certified clinical informaticians.   

## Domains of Informatics
As you might expect from a field with the diversity and quantity of influences as medical informatics, the domains and subspecialties associated with clinical informatics are equally varied. Some of the major domains in medical informatics include translational bioinformatics, imaging informatics, clinical informatics and public health informatics. We’ll briefly review each of these domains, though this set continues to grow.
  
Figure 2 3. Domains of Informatics.

### Translational bioinformatics 
Translational bioinformatics is concerned with the development of methods to optimize the transformation of huge amounts of data, such as those from genetic analyses. This is one example of “big data” and mining of this big data to obtain new knowledge. As you might expect, as we develop methods to store large amounts of data, we have to develop corresponding techniques to enable us to analyze this type of data more effectively. This is the realm of translational bioinformatics. Although translational bioinformatics may at some point influence clinical informatics through their results, it’s not precisely clinical informatics.  

### Imaging informatics
Imaging informatics, or radiology informatics is concerned with the “efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of radiologic services within the medical enterprise.”  Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and other imaging solutions, combined with EHRs and Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) have allowed the field of imaging informatics to grow into its own subspecialty of diagnostic radiology. Imaging informaticians may seek new ways to process and compress images, integrate images into EHRs, mine data from image databases, enhance images, create vocabularies, ontologies, and more. Radiologists may pursue an imaging informatics fellowship if imaging informatics is a field of interest to them.

### Public health informatics 
Public health informatics shares some aspects of translational bioinformatics in that it is concerned with the analysis of large sets of data. However, public health informatics’ focus is to promote and support areas of public health. Some of the unique challenges of public health informatics are the integration of large sets of data that come from disparate sources. This is one of the touch points to clinical informatics because the source of much of the public health informatics data comes from clinical systems.  We will discover and discuss in subsequent sections the importance of, and strategies for, the implementation of standardized data, standardized messaging, and standardized transactions. 

### Clinical informatics
With the many domain of informatics, you can see that clinical informatics is only one facet of several healthcare informatics domains. Clinical informatics varies from many of the other informatics domains in that it couples clinical information systems and the data they produce with the way decisions are made, how leadership and management affect change, and how data and information systems can be used to provide better clinical care. 

## Informatics as a Career
Clinical informaticians work at the intersection of the health system, clinical care, and information and communications technologies. Typically, physician clinical informaticians may hold positions as:
- Chief Medical Information Officers (CMIO)
- Chief Medical Officers (CMO)
- Chief Information Officers (CIO)
- Chief Executive Officers (CEO)
- Fellowship directors
- Healthcare focused software engineers & developers
- Directors of health informatics
Whether you’re already a CMIO or are seeking certification to improve your knowledge base, there are many ways to get involved in the informatics community. You may want to join an existing community within a professional organization (see below), create your own community, or pair your certification with another outside qualification. 
Some online communities you can get involved with include:
- Doximity CMIO Group:
- LinkedIn Clinical Informatics Leadership Group
- LinkedIn Clinical Informatics Board Exam Prep

### Interest Groups
Within the informatics subspecialty, there are numerous specialized interests and working groups you can get involved in.  Whether you’re a big proponent of open source software, would like to improve the health of your region using informatics, or enjoy the organizational management challenges that come with running complex IT systems, there is some way for you to get involved with the informatics community. Table 2 1 lists a sampling of some of the community and workgroup areas within AMIA.

##	Current and Future Challenges for Informatics  
The challenges today and tomorrow for medical informatics lie in several areas. The most prominent of which are interoperability, usability, patient engagement, and ubiquitous care.

###	Interoperability
As we will discuss in detail later in this book, interoperability is a foundational enabling component of nearly everything in healthcare IT. Without interoperability, our EHRs are merely electronic versions of our old paper system. It continues to be a vexing problem which engages many current clinical informaticians.

###	Usability
For health record systems to be useful, they must be usable. Usability is a challenge on many fronts because current electronic health records rely upon providers coding information into an EHR system. Forcing clinicians to take time from their interaction with a patient to essentially encode their diagnoses in a machine-readable format is unnatural to many. This is often cited as one of the primary reasons for physician reluctance and resistance to adopting clinical information systems. 
Resistance to adoption results in workarounds that often defeat the originally intended purpose. For example, many physicians choose to dictate free text into the note area of their health record, as opposed to codifying their information in templates that have been provided. Another common workaround is scanning paper records into the patient’s electronic record. Although these are readable by other humans, they’re not computable in the sense that useful data cannot be extracted from them in a consistent fashion (though optical character recognition coupled with natural language processing research is improving this). 
Improving the usability of our electronic health records is one of the first steps in gaining physician adoption and enabling the collection of standardized and reliable sets of information from our patients. This is foundational to realize the true benefit of clinical information systems.   

###	Patient engagement
Along with the challenges of physician adoption are the challenges of patient adoption. As we move from a fee-for-service payment model to a value-based model where patient engagement will be critical, having reliable systems that the patient can use will be equally critical. The challenges in this area stem from security of health data, the legal and regulatory systems in place to help us navigate responsibilities in a patient centered care environment, and the technology to consistently and reliably collect data from disparate sources (e.g., home blood pressure monitors, fitness trackers, etc.). 
This last category of patient adoption falls within the realm of what’s been referred to as individualized medicine. As our technology improves in terms of being able to rapidly sequence an individual genome, so too must our ability to not only make predictions and recommendations for an individual based upon this growing set of data, but also how we handle this data from an ethical standpoint.   

###	Personalized medicine
Personalized medicine or precision medicine is healthcare customized for the individual patient. Genetics and biological variation in each of us may affect which diseases we are prone to and which drugs are most effective for our conditions. With precision medicine, a patient’s individual DNA, RNA, and proteins may be sequenced and analyzed to paint a broader picture of their health, determine which diseases may represent an increased risk, and how they may be to respond to particular treatments. This advanced level of healthcare using previously unavailable data may reduce a patient’s risk of disease, increase prevention and proactive care, and help us best treat disease when it does occur. 

### Ubiquitous care
The final category of future challenge is that of ubiquitous care. This encompasses a wide range of challenges, from being able to integrate large sets of data between various data sources and rapidly consolidate that information based upon patient identification, to our ability to widely disseminate changes in healthcare recommendations and care guidelines to all clinicians.  This category in many ways is the goal of clinical informatics.

##	Key Concepts, Models, and Theories in Informatics
As we’ve discussed earlier, clinical informatics isn’t just “docs tinkering with data and computers.” Rather, it can be thought of as the clinical application of information sciences. Because of this, as we move through this book, we’ll cover a wide variety of concepts, models, and theories. Below are some of the major theories, models, and concepts we’ll cover in depth in subsequent chapters.
Theories: 
- Bayes Theorem

###	What is Fit for Peer Review?
ABPM outlines that clinical informatics literature is a fundamental piece of clinical informatics. While we’re sure you can determine differences between high-quality research studies and poor studies, let’s take a quick minute to review the topic. When submitting and/or evaluating informatics literature and studies for inclusion in a reputable research journal, you may want to ask the following questions:
- Does this fit the mission of the journal?
- Is the study needed/useful?
- How does it differ from other studies?
- How was the study designed? (comparison, randomization, replication, blocking, orthogonality, factorial experiments)
- What is the sample size and power?
- Were accurate study measures in use?
- Is the study reliable? Could we repeat it?
- Is there bias or flaw in the methods used? (assessment, bias, Hawthorne effect, etc.)
- How valid or accurate are the measurements?
- Are the analysis and discussion sections completed properly?
As an example, submission to the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) requires research articles to include the following sections: 
- Background and Significance
- Objective
- Materials and Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion
Other article types such as case reports, perspectives, briefs, editorials, highlights, and others may not require as detailed information, depending on the journal. 

###	Critically Analyzing Literature
In the Evidence Based Medicine section of this book (Chapter 5), we will cover performing a critical analysis of literature through study and statistical methods, bias, validity, and other analysis methods, as well as foreground/background questions and information retrieval. 

##	International Clinical Informatics Practices  
The United States is not alone in its efforts to bring the power of clinical informatics to bear in caring for its patients. Many other nations are facing similar challenges and one of the primary organizations to enrich the international community’s efforts in this discipline is the International Medical Informatics Association.  
As the current president of the IMIA stated in the 2014 yearbook of the international medical informatics Association, “Health informatics has evolved from very disruptive, though stand-alone, computer applications to nation-wide eHealth structures, programs and strategies.”  
A universal observation within all the international communities incorporating informatics is that the impact of clinical informatics falls short of the expectation.  Frustrations with usability, interoperability and adoption are universal. Countries with a multitude of payers and insurance companies place more of their IT resources on addressing financial and eligibility concerns.

##	Ethics in Clinical Informatics
As with other specialties, clinical informatics poses its own questions with regards to ethics. The large amounts of private health data that clinicians and IT staff analyze may result in new correlations or causations that may affect a patient’s decision on treatment and may even impact their longevity. 
Below is a simplified list of professional ethical do’s and don’ts. We’ll also summarize ethical concepts, ethical decision-making, and some of the current topics in informatics and medicine in case you haven’t reviewed them in a while. 

###	Professional Ethical Conduct
You can find AMIA’s Code of Professional and Ethical Conduct via their website at http://www.amia.org/about-amia/ethics. It is a short, two-page read and is worth glimpsing over. To sum it up, the code of conduct offers the following guidelines to informaticians regarding patient information:
- DO facilitate their legal rights to their health information
- DO safeguard their healthcare information consistent with legal and industry standards
- DO act in a courteous, timely, respectful, and professional manner
- DO alert colleagues to potential issues and bugs in their systems that may affect patients
- DO lead by example by practicing and promoting ethical and professional behavior
- DO follow ethicolegal mandates when you feel that something is “off”
- DO engage in ethical and legal research that moves clinical informatics forward
- DO encourage the growth of informatics through research, teaching, professional development, encouragement, and other appropriate methods. 
- DO NOT disclose data in inappropriate or illegal ways
- DO NOT mislead patients regarding the use of their healthcare information
Be sure to check out the latest version, as it is a “living” document and may be occasionally updated. 

###	Conflict of Interest
Individuals who make decisions and conduct affairs on behalf of professional groups may be required to disclose any potential conflicts of interests that may affect their ability to make unbiased decisions. 
The Council of Medical Specialty Societies (CMSS) has developed its own voluntary code for societies that guide their interactions with companies. By opting to follow this code, medical specialty societies are expected to maintain objectivity and minimize perceived and actual conflicts of interest. To do this, guidelines and principles for interaction are outlined to cover the following topics: independence, transparency, charitable contributions, corporate sponsorships, society meetings, research grants, clinical practice guidelines, journals, and advertising and licensing. 

###	Hippocratic Oath
The Hippocratic Oath can be thought of as one of the original ethical guides for physicians. It reminds us to do no harm, maintain a patient’s privacy, teach others, and follow other basic rules. 
With particular relevance to the field of clinical informatics, the Hippocratic Oath states, in part:  
…Whatever, in the course of my practice, I may see or hear (even when not invited), whatever I may happen to obtain knowledge of, if it be not proper to repeat it, I will keep sacred and secret within my own breast…

###	FTC Fair Information Practice
As part of the FTC’s objectives for maintaining the privacy and ethical collection of consumer’s private data, it has developed the Fair Information Practice to provide recommendations on how to practice fair and adequate information privacy. As part of its guidelines, the FTC outlines five core principles:
- Notice/Awareness: consumers should know how their data is being used
- Choice/Consent: consumers should be given the option to ‘opt-in’ or ‘opt-out’
- Access/Participation: consumers should be able to access the data collected on them
- Integrity/Security: consumer’s collected data should be accurate and secure
- Enforcement/Redress: compliance with these rules may be self-regulatory, privately remedied, or enforced by the government

###	Human Rights
A human right is a right that belongs to every person. The United Nations has outlined 30 basic human rights in “The Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. We’re not going to go through all 30 rights, however article 25 of UDHR has the most impact on healthcare. It states the following: 
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.

###	Ethical Concepts
Ethical concepts are abstract thoughts and ideas that deal with ethics. Within medical ethics, the four basic principles include autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Below is a list of examples of ethical concepts as they relate to clinical practice and clinical informatics:  
- Autonomy
  - Freedom from external control or influence; independence.
  - Clinical Example: Informed consent
- Beneficence/ Nonmaleficence 
  - Action that is done for the benefit of others/ An obligation not to inflict harm intentionally
  - Clinical Example: The Hippocratic Oath—Maximize good, minimize harm
- Justice 
  - Just behavior and treatment to all people
  - Clinical Example: Deciding who receives an organ transplant
- Best Interest Standard 
  - Determining the best interest of an individual who cannot make decisions for him or herself
  - Clinical Example: Making decisions on the patient’s behalf when a patient cannot make an informed decision
- Confidentiality
  - Rules or promises that limit access to or place restrictions on information discerned or communicated during a patient consultation
  - Clinical Example: Revealing information to a patient’s family member if the patient has not given explicit permission to do so
- Disclosure
  - Information relevant to the patient’s understanding of their condition, treatment options, and potential outcomes must be provided for the patient to make well-informed decisions
  - Clinical Example: Explaining the risks and benefits of possible treatment options to a patient
- Fidelity
  - Faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty and support
  - Clinical Example: Patient trust of healthcare providers
- Informed Consent
  - Medical intervention should not be done if the patient has not given implicit or explicit consent to do so
  - Clinical Example: Consent can be implied if the patient seeks out medical care or explicit if they sign a consent form
- Rights 
  - Entitlement or claim others are obliged to respect
  - Clinical Example: Privacy and confidentiality laws
- Veracity
  - Habitual truthfulness
  - Clinical Example: Use of placebos in medical research, full disclosure by patients

###	Ethical Theories
Ethical theories systematize, defend and recommend concepts of right and wrong conduct, often addressing disputes of moral diversity. Some ethical theories and terminology you should be familiar with include: 
- Normative Ethical Theories: investigate how one should morally act
- Virtue Ethics: the study of character
  - One who follows virtue ethics believes that being “good” is shown through character, rather than deeds or actions.
  - Famous Virtue Ethicist: Aristotle
- Deontology: the study of the nature of duty and obligation
  - A deontologist would hold true to their obligations to others and to society when evaluating an ethical dilemma. They would keep promises made and follow the law. 
  - Famous Deontologist: Immanuel Kant
- Consequentialism: the belief an action is moral or immoral depending on the result of the action
  - A consequentialist would believe that the harm of one person to save one-hundred people would be moral
  - Further branches of consequentialism include: 
    - Utilitarianism: the theory that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority
    - Egoism: the study of the self and its needs
    - Intellectualism: the action that promotes the most knowledge is best
    - Care Ethics: the study of relationships, empathy, and vulnerability
- A believer in care ethics would say we must respond to situations in an attentive, responsible, competent, and responsive way and that empathy and compassion shape how we view morality.
- Famous care ethicist: Carol Gilligan
    - Pragmatic Ethics: Moral progress in society is similar to its progression in science
- A pragmatic ethicist focuses on society rather than individual, moral criteria can be revised, and what is morally appropriate for a society at one point may not be in the future.
- Famous Pragmatic Ethics Follower: John Dewey
    - Role Ethics: based on family roles
- A believer of role ethics derives morality based on their relationship with their community
- Famous Role Ethicist: Confucius
- Meta-Ethics: Seeks to understand ethical properties, such as “what is good?” “what is bad?”, “how can we tell the difference?”
  - Semantic theories in meta-ethics seek to answer the question “What is the meaning of moral terms or judgments?”
    - Examples of semantic theories include moral realism, ethical subjectivism, error-theory, emotivism, etc.
  - Substantial theories in meta-ethics seek to answer the question “What is the nature of moral judgments?”
    - Substantial theories include moral universalism, moral relativism, and moral nihilism
  - Justification theories in meta-ethics seek to answer the question “Why be moral?”
    - Justification theories include moral skepticism, ethical intuitionism, empiricism, and moral rationalism
- Descriptive Ethics: the study of people’s beliefs on morality
  - Descriptive ethics empirically studies the attitudes and beliefs of individuals and/or groups
  - Famous descriptive ethicist: Lawrence Kohlberg	
- Applied Ethics: the moral examination of private and public life issues that are matters of moral judgment
  - Applied ethics may apply to specific topics or professions, such as bioethics, which may ask moral questions regarding, for example, beginning of life, quality of life, death and dying.

###	Ethical Decision Making
Ethical decision-making, as you’ve likely experienced, is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors include:
- Professional Codes of Ethics
- Patient Rights
- Laws
- Standards
- Values
- Rights
- Technology
- Personal Experience
- Religion
- Regulation
- Morals
- Culture
With the factors and possible repercussions of ethical decisions, the following questions derived from Harman’s Ethical Challenges in the Management of Health Information may help guide these decisions. 
- What are the ethical questions? What is the issue?
- What are the facts?
- What are the competing values, obligations, interests? Who is involved?
- What are my options?
- What should I do? 
- What justifies my choice?
- How can I prevent this from happening again?
Ethical decision making in healthcare can be a complex process. By following a decision-making process, individuals and organizations may make better ethical decisions, even in the face of difficult scenarios. Decision-making will be covered in more depth in the Clinical Decision Making and Care Process Improvement section (Chapter 4), but the factors involved with ethical questions often exceed the bounds of our routine clinical decision making process, so the mere awareness of these additional factors can aid in framing ethical decisions.

###	Current Topics in Bioethics
Bioethics studies ethical issues in biology and medicine resulting from advances in science and technology. Bioethicists may analyze the topics below as well as others based on the four principles of bioethics—autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. 
Table 2 2 below lists some current topics in bioethics. It is by no means all-inclusive. These are only some examples of major topics in bioethics today.

##	Legal and Regulatory Issues
As you know, healthcare is a highly regulated industry. As a provider, you may be familiar with the overarching issues that affect the way your organization’s health systems are run. However, as a manager and leader of healthcare IT systems, you’ll have to have additional knowledge regarding the IT policies that affect your organization as well as strategies to incorporate them into your long- and short-term plans. We will highlight and review some of the more important legal and regulatory issues facing health IT, though some (like HIPAA, PPACA, HITECH, and now MACRA) will be covered in much more detail later in the book. 

###	HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA or sometimes referred to as the Kennedy-Kassebaum Act) protects health insurance coverage for personnel and their families when they lose or change jobs as well as governs electronic transactions in health care. HIPAA compliance is a necessary but costly and time-consuming requirement for health care providers and organizations. HIPAA is further discussed in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) section.

###	PPACA
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a federal statute aimed to increase the affordability, accessibility, and quality of health insurance. Many health care organizations are facing decreased reimbursements, increased financial strain, and other issues since the act has been passed, though it may still be too early to understand the long-term ramifications. In addition to these issues, parts of the Act’s constitutionality have also been debated. The Affordable Care Act will be discussed further in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) section.

###	HITECH
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act is a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aimed at promoting the adoption and Meaningful Use of health information technology. Meaningful Use (sometimes referred to as “MU”) aims to improve patient care through increased adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). As part of the requirements outlined in the HITECH Act, healthcare organizations must show that they are using their EHRs in a “meaningful way” defined by objectives that must be met to receive an incentive payment. The need to attest to Meaningful Use has been an issue for health care organizations who may not have the resources needed to meet all requirements. Penalties for non-compliance also exist.  HITECH and the implications and requirements for Meaningful Use will be further discussed in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) section. 

###	Joint Commission Standards
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO, or simply the Joint Commission) is an accrediting organization whose mission is to “…continuously improve health care for the public, in collaboration with other stakeholders, by evaluating health care organizations and inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective care of the highest quality and value.”  In order to meet licensure requirements for Medicaid reimbursement, healthcare organizations must be certified by JCAHO or a competing accreditation organization.  There are some requirements, such as RC.01.01.01 (requiring hospitals to maintain accurate records) that are addressed by having an EHR that meets Meaningful Use criteria, so there is overlap in some of the regulatory requirements. There are indications that many of the quality and regulatory requirements for electronic health records will be consolidated in the future to simplify development and implementation. 

##	Chapter Two Key Points
- Clinical informatics is the application of informatics, clinical knowledge, and technology to continuously improve healthcare systems, services, and outcomes
- Converting from written records to electronic health records has been one of the greatest challenges in the health information technology industry.
